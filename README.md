When working as the Product Owner, interpreting the users needs is the bread and butter of this role. By engaging with the end users and the stakeholders I was able to get feedback and detailed user stories which helped to align the development to the user needs. By creating the user stories, it set up the tasks the development team needed to accomplish to successfully create the product. By taking the user feedback and making these user stories, we can ensure the program stays on task, and the development is directly changed by the users. <br/><br/>
I have learned how important feedback is throughout this entire course. By continually taking the feedback of my programs into account I can create iterations of my development based on this feedback. Test-Driven Development is an agile practice I will absolutely put in place in the future to help with my efficiency and bug finding capability. <br/><br/>
Being a good team member in software development is constantly assessing yourself and finding your shortcomings to become a better programmer and more efficient member of the team. Being a good team member is giving constant communication with the rest of the team so they all know where you are at. Being a good team member is supporting your team through their challenges and always lifting them up.
